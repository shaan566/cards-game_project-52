Card Game
This is a simple command-line card game where four players compete to select the highest card from a given suit. The deck is shuffled and distributed equally among the players. Each player then chooses a card, and the game determines the winner based on the highest card of a specified suit.

How to Play
1 Start the Game: The game shuffles a deck of 52 cards (comprising Clubs ♣, Diamonds ♦, Hearts ♥, and Spades ♠) and distributes them evenly among four players.

2 View Cards: Players can choose to view their own set of cards or all players' cards at once.

3 Select Cards: Each player selects a card by its index from their hand.

4 Determine the Winner: The game checks if all selected cards belong to the same suit. If they do, it determines the winner based on the highest card rank. If the cards belong to different suits, the game announces that the selected cards are from different suits.
